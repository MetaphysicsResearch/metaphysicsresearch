## Original Prompt (Article April 10)

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, regardless of its mainstream acceptance. Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics, including analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other perspectives. Evaluate how well each framework accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics, such as the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.


## Prompt 1: Full prompt

As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality. 
Evaluate how well each framework accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in 21st-century research.
Conclude by identifying the strongest framework(s).
Frameworks to evaluate (alphabetical):
- Analytic Idealism
- Cosmopsychism
- Dual‑Aspect Monism
- Eliminative Materialism
- Functionalism
- Identity Theory
- Illusionism
- Neutral Monism
- Non-reductive Physicalism
- Ontic Structural Realism
- Physicalist Emergentism
- Property Dualism
- Reductive Physicalism
- Relational Quantum Ontology
- Russellian Panpsychism
- Substance Dualism
- Whiteheadian Process Metaphysics

## Prompt 2: No "... 21st-century research."

## Complementary prompt:

Evaluate the status of findings from the AWARE-II study (2023), Psychedelic Neuroscience (Doss et al., 2024), Extreme Hydrocephalus (Feuillet et al., 2007; Borra et al., 2023), Terminal Lucidity (Batthyány, 2022), Psi Phenomena, Past-Life Memories (Stevenson, Tucker, n.d.), and Triple-Blind Mediumship Studies (Beischel et al., 2015). Should these findings alter the assessment conclusions?
Again, conclude by identifying the strongest framework(s).
