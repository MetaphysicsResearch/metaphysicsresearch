# ############################
## OLD 

# Draft 

* materialism, dualism, panpsychism, or idealism
    Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics, including the most advanced forms of physicalism, monism, dualism, panpsychism, idealism, and others.
* contemporary science -> more neutral
    Evaluate how well each framework accommodates the most challenging empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in contemporary science.

Prioritize frameworks based on explanatory coherence and compatibility with evidence, regardless of mainstream acceptance. Conclude with a clear recommendation on which framework best accommodates these findings.


# Main prompt

We choose PROMPT 3 as the most adequate:
"regardless of its mainstream status"
If we remove this clause, most AIs responses that favor physicalism, have arguments that cite its dominance, trend, acceptance, etc, despite its limitations. So this clause is intentional to avoid such bias. 
Example:
    "If forced to choose based on dominant trends in contemporary analytic philosophy and alignment with scientific methodology, **Physicalism (specifically, non-reductive physicalism or emergentism)** is often presented as the *currently most workable starting point*, despite the acknowledged severity of the problem of consciousness."

"accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science, contemporary physics, neuroscience, and related fields"
This clause is intentional to challenge against cutting edge science, not only classical themes. We the must up to date framework in terms of science compatibility. 


## PROMPT 5
As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, regardless of its mainstream acceptance. Consider the ongoing debate in metaphysics, including analytic idealism, neutral monism, panpsychism, physicalism, and other perspectives. Evaluate how well each framework accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science and contemporary physics, such as the hard problem of consciousness, quantum non-locality, the measurement problem, dark matter and dark energy, the black hole information paradox, the amplituhedron, and cosmological polytopes.

## PROMPT 4
