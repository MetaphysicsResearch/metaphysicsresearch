## Chalmers feedback
functionalism, illusionism, identity theory, dualism


## Inclusions

Analytic Idealism: Good inclusion. Contemporary version (e.g., Kastrup) explicitly engages with science and offers a distinct metaphysical alternative.
Cosmopsychism: Good. A significant variant within the panpsychism debate, offering a specific macro-level consciousness model.
Dual‑Aspect Monism: Good. Classic alternative to dualism and physicalism, relevant to consciousness studies.
Eliminative Materialism: Good. Radical but influential form of physicalism, directly engages neuroscience/psychology.
Functionalism: Good. While primarily a theory of mind, its implications for metaphysics (especially within physicalism) and relevance to AI/computation make it essential.
Identity Theory: Good. Foundational physicalist theory of mind, historically important benchmark.
Illusionism: Good. A prominent contemporary position on consciousness within (usually) physicalism.
Neutral Monism: Good. Historically significant, experiencing renewed interest, offers a unique monistic alternative.
Non-reductive Physicalism: Excellent inclusion. Represents a major, arguably dominant, position attempting to reconcile physicalism with non-reducible phenomena like mind.
Ontic Structural Realism: Excellent inclusion. Directly motivated by interpretations of modern physics (QM, GR), focuses on structure.
Physicalist Emergentism: Good. Captures the idea of fundamentally new properties/entities arising from lower levels, crucial for debates in biology, chemistry, and mind within a physicalist or non-physicalist context.
Property Dualism: Good. Present in contemporary philosophy of mind (e.g., Chalmers, Nagel).
Reductive Physicalism: Excellent inclusion. Replaces "Flat Materialism" with the canonical term. This is the standard baseline physicalist view.
Relational Quantum Ontology: Good. Represents a specific, influential ontological interpretation of QM focusing on relations.
Russellian Panpsychism: Good. A major contemporary version of panpsychism focusing on the intrinsic nature of matter.
Whiteheadian Process Metaphysics: Good. A comprehensive alternative focusing on process, with potential links to physics and biology.


## Exclusions

Aristotelian‑Thomistic Metaphysics: Good Exclusion. While rigorous, its direct engagement with specific 21st-century scientific puzzles (QM entanglement, dark energy, etc.) is less direct than OSR, RQM, or even physicalist frameworks.
Digital Physics / Digital Ontology: Good Exclusion. Often speculative, less developed as distinct philosophical frameworks compared to others. Overlaps with functionalism/information themes.
Holographic-AdS/CFT Ontology: Good Exclusion. Primarily a physics principle/conjecture, not yet a fully developed philosophical metaphysical framework. Its implications might be discussed within other frameworks (like OSR or physicalism).
Quantum Darwinism: Good Exclusion. A specific physical mechanism for classical emergence, not a full metaphysical framework itself. It informs other frameworks but isn't one.
Object-Oriented Ontology: Good Exclusion. Different philosophical tradition/focus, less centrally engaged with accommodating scientific findings in the way the prompt emphasizes compared to analytic frameworks like OSR or physicalism.
Mereological Structuralism: Good Exclusion. Sub-variant/overlap with OSR, which captures the main thrust.
Causal Set Theory Ontology: Good Exclusion. Specific physics research program, not a widely debated philosophical framework.
Tropes Theory: Good Exclusion. Theory of properties, not a complete metaphysics of reality itself. Can be part of various frameworks.
Phenomenalism: Good Exclusion. Limited contemporary viability and less direct engagement with accommodating modern scientific findings.
Pragmatist Metaphysics: Good Exclusion. Often anti-metaphysical or revisionary in a way that sidesteps the prompt's request for a rigorous account of reality.
Information-Theoretic Ontologies: Good Exclusion. Often slogans ("It from Bit") or underdeveloped programs lacking the philosophical rigor of the included frameworks.
Mereological Nihilism: Good Exclusion. Specific thesis about composition, not a complete framework.
Modal Realism (Lewisian): Good Exclusion. Focuses on modality, tenuous connection to accommodating empirical science.
Constructive Empiricism: Good Exclusion. Epistemological stance on science, not a metaphysics of reality.
Substance Dualism: Good. The classic foil to physicalism, consider Property Dualism instead.
Pansemiotism: Good Exclusion. Less canonical and less directly focused on the prompt's specific science criteria compared to included frameworks.
Panentheism: Good Exclusion. Primarily theological, introduces commitments outside the likely scope of the prompt.
