As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, regardless of its mainstream acceptance.
Use the following uniform criteria: empirical adequacy, explanatory scope, ontological parsimony, conceptual coherence, and ability to address consciousness and quantum phenomena.
Frameworks to evaluate include (in alphabetical order):
* Dualisms (Anomalous Monism, Hylomorphic Substance Dualism, Property Dualism)
* Emergentisms (Double‑Aspect, Strong, Weak)
* Enactivism/Embodied Realism
* Holographic/AdS–CFT Ontologies
* Idealisms (Analytic, Subjective, Transcendental)
* Information‑Theoretic (Digital Physics, Pancomputationalism)
* Monisms (Analytic Idealism, Neutral/Dual‑Aspect, Panpsychism)
* Physicalisms (Functionalism, Identity Theory, Non‑Reductive, Reductive)
* Process Philosophy
* Quantum‑Interpretation Ontologies (Collapse Theories, Many‑Worlds, QBism)
* Relational & Structural Realism
* Speculative Realism/New Materialism
* (Feel free to consider any other relevant frameworks.)
