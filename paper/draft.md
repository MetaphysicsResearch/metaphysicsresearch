As an AI system with advanced reasoning capabilities, assess which metaphysical framework offers the most philosophically rigorous account of reality, regardless of its mainstream status. Evaluate how well each framework accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science, contemporary physics, neuroscience, and related fields.

"regardless of its mainstream status"
If we remove this clause, most AIs responses that favor physicalism, have arguments that cite its dominance, trend, acceptance, etc, despite its limitations. So this clause is intentional to avoid such bias. 
Example:
    "If forced to choose based on dominant trends in contemporary analytic philosophy and alignment with scientific methodology, **Physicalism (specifically, non-reductive physicalism or emergentism)** is often presented as the *currently most workable starting point*, despite the acknowledged severity of the problem of consciousness."

"accommodates empirical findings and theoretical puzzles in consciousness science, contemporary physics, neuroscience, and related fields"
This clause is intentional to challenge against cutting edge science, not only classical themes. We the must up to date framework in terms of science compatibility.
